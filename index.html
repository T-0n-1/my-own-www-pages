          <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
          <p>
            I am Toni Mertanen - entrepreneur, student and a father of four
            lovely daughters. I have started my working life as a seventeen year
            old college student. I was picked literally from the front door of
            the apartment I lived with my family at the time. From the bottle
            and cart boy in the beginning to present work as a K-retailer
            entrepreneur I have done all the different jobs in a grocery store
            one possibly can. As an employee I worked my whole working life in a
            bigger grocery store under two different K-retailers, many superiors
            and collaborators. Working with many superiors and collaborators
            have given me the competence to work with different kind of people
            and teams. Over ten years as an entrepreneur have given the ability
            to lead those superiors and employees. Abilities such as stress
            endurance, fast decision making and solution based working are few
            key features of entrepreneur. We have shared some of the main
            responsibilities with my wife and my regions are staff and
            stakeholder relations and all systems and programs at our grocery
            store.

          <h2>Student</h2>
          <p>
            I have always loved different kind of systems, computers and
            gadgets. The desire to find out what is the logic behind them and
            the fast growing digitalization in the field of grocery trade -
            especially inside K group - drove me to apply to LAB University of
            Applied Sciences. After passing the entrance exams I found myself
            studying to become an engineer of information and communication
            technology. All the studies are remote studies and at the moment
            writing this I have studied for one and half years. It is of course
            sometimes a bit hard to combine work, studies and family life. I
            also have noticed that I am like a child in a candy store - so many
            nice interesting new things to choose from. But as an entrepreneur I
            manage my own calendar and I have taken all the possible free
            moments to study. I have acquired many courses from internet to
            advance the studies taken in school and many topics outside the
            school courses. Studies have also expanded my hobbies. I have for
            example built home automation system using Home Assistant and
            Raspberry Pi 4. I also like to code as a hobby. Most of the studies
            actually feel like hobby - I sometimes find myself going through
            some code without noticing time passing.

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i>
          My first PC was IBM 386SX and I was using Disk Operating System at the
          time. Computer was used with Command Line Interface - starting a game
          required running exe or bat files from command line. My later
          experience before studies was mainly from Windows operating systems. I
          bought a new Macbook Pro for my studies and after that I have been
          using it for 99% of time - both for studies and own projects. I use
          the old Windows desktop nowadays mostly for gaming and programming
          tasks when ever studies require a program that is not compatible with
          MacOS. I can operate Linux and MacOS from the command line.

        <p>
          <i class="fab fa-git-square"></i><i class="fab fa-github"></i> I had
          my first real experience of Git and Github when I was conducting my
          first internship at the artifial intelligence group of Kesko - K-AI. I
          took a complete course of Git at
          <a href="http://www.codewithmosh.com" target="_blank"
            >Code with Mosh</a
          >
          and have been using Git for school tasks and own projects ever since.
          The CLI of Git - reset, rebase, branches etc - and Github - pull
          request, merges etc - are not new to me. This simple website is served
          straight from Github using Github Pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fab fa-docker"></i>
          I heard Docker mentioned many times before studies. I feel bad I
          waited so long before I started to study even the basics of it. At the
          moment I am going through course of Docker and the more I learn about
          it the more I desire to use it in real life scenarios. I think that
          discovering Docker is as profound for me as it was to learn what
          Version Control System like Git was.

        <p>
          <i class="home__assistant"></i>
          At the school course of IoT basics we had a team project. In the
          project we had to dive into Home Assistant on theoretical level and
          come up with user cases for the program. Project was interesting and I
          wanted to dive in deeper. After flashing the memory card of my
          Raspberry Pi 4 with Home Assistant, I started testing the program and
          integrating my IoT devices into it. It is for the most part quite easy
          to integrate even older devices and system is not vendor bound at all.
          At moment I have few switches and lights automated and camera system
          with two presence detectors waiting for integration.

          <i class="fab fa-markdown"></i>
          In the beginning of 2022 I started a new interesting course called
          Software testing and mainteance. As a part of this course lecturer
          taught us about Markdown. I have never come upon it before. I run a
          Google search about Markdown and discovered that it is used for
          example documenting inside Git repositories. Further search revealed
          to me that this documenting is actually quite important part (of
          course) of software development. I have not used Markdown to document
          my earliest repositories - so I have some catching up to do. Using
          Markdown isn't actually complicated to do, simple and elegant tool for
          writing documents and text for example inside webpage or email.

          <i class="fab fa-python"></i><i class="k-ai"></i>
          I had studied only the basics of Python programming when I began my
          first internship at the Artificial Intelligence group of Kesko. I had
          decided that if K-AI agrees to have me as an intern I would do
          anything to learn more about it. I studied Python programming more and
          tried my best to understand the basics of Pandas and Numpy - libraries
          which both were used in the K-AI group. With a great help from K-AI
          team I managed to study Python programming so well and fast that in
          the end of my internship I was able to code independently and now my
          code is a part of assortment control program used almost daily in
          every K grocery store. I have also studied more about Object-Oriented
          Programming and databases.

          <i class="virtual__machine"></i>
          I have completed the basics of server and workstation virtualization.
          I continued to learn more on my own and have tested Virtualbox with
          both of my computers - I have successfully virtualized Windows and
          different Linux operating systems - I have for example virtually run
          Raspberry Pi with SenseHat for one school task.

          really interested in web development. Struckturing pages with HTML and
          styling with CSS is really fascinating. I have studied few courses in
          school and complete course in
          <a href="http://www.codewithmosh.com" target="_blank"
            >Code with Mosh</a

          I have studied JavaScript at school and have gone through several
          articles in internet. I also have complete course of it waiting after
          I have finished the Docker course. I have already used it on my school
          tasks and own projects. I have also studied JQuery on my own and have
          used it on some projects.

          There is lot to learn - the more I study the more I understand how
          little I know. I have acquired courses of React, Node.js, Angular, C#
          and SQL and these are the next steps for me to take after finishing
          Docker and JavaScript courses. I will be updating my experience as I
          keep learning new things.
